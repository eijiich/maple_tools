Thanks for providing all the necessary files. Your project structure and the code you've shown look like a solid foundation for a to-do list application with additional features for MapleStory. Based on what you shared, here are a few suggestions and potential questions to guide you further:

### Suggestions and Improvements

2. **Form Validation**:
   - In `AddTask.tsx`, you're already doing basic validation for the task input. Consider expanding this to validate other fields such as `partySize`, ensuring the value is a positive integer, etc. 

3. **User Feedback**:
   - You could provide user feedback when actions are completed (like adding or deleting a task), rather than just using alerts. You could implement a toast notification system for a cleaner user experience.

5. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Consider improving the UI by handling loading states while fetching data from `indexedDB`, adding CSS animations when adding or removing tasks, and possibly enhancing the visual aspect of your dialogs and forms.

6. **Feature Extensions**:
   - If you're interested in additional features down the line, consider adding categorization for tasks or an archive feature to keep the main lists clean.

7. **Testing**: 
   - Implement unit tests where possible to ensure that each component behaves as expected. You can use libraries like Jest or React Testing Library for this purpose.

### Questions for You

1. **What specific functionality are you looking to enhance or troubleshoot?**
   - For example, are there specific errors you're encountering or features you'd like to implement next?

2. **Are you considering any state management libraries?**
   - Depending on how complex your application becomes, libraries like Redux or Zustand might become beneficial for managing your application's state.

3. **What's your plan for deployment?**
   - Have you thought about where you'd like to host your web application once you've finished development (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.)?

4. **Do you intend to add user authentication in the future?**
   - Given youâ€™re adding a character and task-related features, having user profiles might enhance the experience for MapleStory players.

Feel free to let me know if you have specific questions regarding any part of the code or if there are other areas you'd like assistance with!
